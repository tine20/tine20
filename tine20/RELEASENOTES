# GENERAL CHANGES (Administrative)

## MySQL 8 Support

But be careful, MySQL 8.0.20 has a major bug (see https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=99398 for more information) and should not be used!
We mitigated the bug before, but removed that because it created other issues (see commit 77abad0).

    $ setup.php --clear_cache [-v]
