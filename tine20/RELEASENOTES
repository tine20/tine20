GENERAL CHANGES
---

* New Icon Set

* PHP 7.2 Support

* AreaLocks
It is possible to define protection for certain areas of Tine 2.0. For example, it might be required to give a PIN if you
 want to access the Sales application.

 Example configuration of a Sales app AreaLock with PIN:

     'userPin' => true,
     'areaLocks' => [
         'records' => [
             [
                 'area' => 'Sales',
                 'provider' => 'Pin',
                 'validity' => 'session', // it is only required to give the pin once per session
             ]
         ]
     ],

* Access Log Cleanup

Access Log Entries are not removed if older than 7 days be default. You can use the config option
 'accessLogRotationDays' to define a custom rotation.

* MySQL with UTF8 MB4 charset

We changed the default charset to UTF8MB4. All tables in the Tine 2.0 Database can be converted using a CLI method.
This requires either MySQL 5.7.7+ or MariaDB 10.2.2+ with default settings. Earlier versions are supported
 with non default settings. MySQL 5.6+ and MariaDB 10.0+ need to set:
    innodb_large_prefix = 1
    innodb_file_format = 'Barracuda'
    innodb_file_per_table = 'ON'
The conversion script will test these settings and abort if prerequisites are not met.
the CLI method to convert to utf8mb4 is "setup.php --migrateUtf8mb4"

* Improved Branding customization via configuration

options: BRANDING_TITLE,BRANDING_LOGO,BRANDING_DESCRIPTION,BRANDING_WEBURL,BRANDING_HELPURL,BRANDING_FAVICON,INSTALL_LOGO, ...

* Sentry.io integration

If you have a sentry.io server which collects your errors, you can just add it to Tine 2.0 by setting this config:

    'sentryUri' => 'https://USER:PW@sentry.my.domain/2', // note: no double slashes in uri except after "https:"
