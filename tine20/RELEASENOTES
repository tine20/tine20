#GENERAL CHANGES
---

### PHP extension intl is now mandatory

### PHP extension bcmath is required for AD integration

### MySQL with UTF8 MB4 charset

We changed the default charset to UTF8MB4. All tables in the Tine 2.0 Database can be converted using a CLI method.
This requires either MySQL 5.7.7+ or MariaDB 10.2.2+ with default settings. Earlier versions are supported
 with non default settings. MySQL 5.6+ and MariaDB 10.0+ need to set:
    innodb_large_prefix = 1
    innodb_file_format = 'Barracuda'
    innodb_file_per_table = 'ON'
The conversion script will test these settings and abort if prerequisites are not met.
the CLI method to convert to utf8mb4 is "setup.php --migrateUtf8mb4"

### OpenID Connect support

SSO via OpenID Connect has been added. Add this to your config to make it work:

    'sso' => [
        'active' => true,
        'providerUrl' => 'OIDC_PROVIDER_URL',
        'clientId' => 'CLIENT_ID_STRING',
        'clientSecret' => 'CLIENT_SECRET_STRING',
        'redirectUrl' => 'YOUR_LOCAL_TINE_URL',
    ],

You also have to add the users email address (known by the sso provider) as "open id" in the user record.
