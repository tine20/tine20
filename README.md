# Tine 2.0 - Community Edition

## Free Software without compromise
In contrast to the so called "open core" approach, where only a subset of the software is released as open source, 
you'll find the complete sourcecode of all standard Tine 2.0 applications and features here. Like RHEL is the stable 
extract of Fedora, our Business Edition is a approved subset of stable code combined with a long term business support.

Everything you need to build and run Tine 2.0 is released as free software. See the LICENSE file for more details. 
Unlike others, our community edition is no baitfish for closed source plugins or add ons.

## Home of Innovation
Together with our great community of open source addicted developers and testers, we build new features, try out
exciting concepts and drive innovation within the Tine 2.0 Community Edition. As a user you become a member of this 
community and we expect you to support innovation by creating code, reporting bugs or improving the documentation.

With the Tine 2.0 Community Edition you are always provided with the latest additions. For the sake of innovation we 
don't fix bugs or supply security updates for old versions.

## Support
In general, users of the Community Edition are technically experienced and able to help themselves. The ability to read,
understand and change the software as well as to share the new version with others really is the heart of free software.

Moreover, in our [Issues and Questions Section](https://github.com/tine20/tine20/issues)
you can get support from other community members. As a rule of thumb: You can expect more support from others the more
you contribute yourself. Don't expect others to contribute if you are not willing to contribute yourself. Remember: We
are a community of free software enthusiasts and innovators. If you are out for a good Samaritan you need to look
elsewhere.

There is no commercial support for the community edition at all. Please be fair and don't try to suck community
resources if you are not willing or able to contribute to the community. In this case the community edition is not 
appropriate for you, please go with the business edition.

## Business Edition
For all those who are not willing or able to be part of the community as an active contributor, and for organisations
who prefer stability and support over innovation we created our [Tine 2.0 Business Edition](http://www.tine20.com).

Once a year we take a subset of well proven and stable applications and features from our community edition and build
a new major release of our business edition.

Each [Tine 2.0 Business Edition](http://www.tine20.com) is maintained with security patches and bug fixes for at least two 
years. Our [partners](https://www.tine20.com/partner/) offer a wide range of commercial support for different business needs.
